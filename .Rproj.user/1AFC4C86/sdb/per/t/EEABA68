How confident are you of winning the best of 100 rolls?  \nOn each roll, highest score wins.  \nYou can't get a tie with these dice.\n\nTheory\n========================================================\nThese non transitive dice illustrate the counter intuitive principle\nthat  \nDie A is better than Die B  \nand  \nDie B is better than Die C  \nbut strangely  \nDie A is not better than Die C. In fact Die C is better than Die A.  \n\n```r\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n\nSlide With Plot\n========================================================\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](Dice.Rmd-figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) \n",
